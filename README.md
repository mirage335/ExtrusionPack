Extruder mounting hardware for Taz_Mega, other OpenBuilds machines, and any other machine which can accept a metal bracket. Specifically designed to accomodate LulzBot brand Gregs/Wade extruder derivatives with Hexagon or Merlin hotends.

Three extruders are supported per pack. Recommended configuration is as follows.

Exotic materials.	1 * FlexyStruder, Hexagon, 0.5mm nozzle
Support/Infill.		1 * Gregs/Wade LulzBot Variant, Hexagon, 1mm nozzle (manually drilled)

Hard materials.		1 * Gregs/Wade LulzBot Variant, Hexagon, 0.35mm nozzle

Use of bowden extensions or half-height steppers on the last two extruders is recommended if possible.

#Electronics
Duet/Duex electronics with PatchRap strongly recommended.
